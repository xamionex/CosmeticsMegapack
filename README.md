# Why this was made

Got tired of having MoreCompany causing issues with items sometimes so I decided to make this to make use of AdvancedCompany instead
(More like MoreCompany is not needed because I have AdvancedCompany now)
You can find any cosmetic mod I used below.

The mod icon was something I made 2 years ago with photoshop, get spooked nub
